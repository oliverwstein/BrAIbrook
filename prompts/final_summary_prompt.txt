CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Page Number Accuracy:
   - ONLY use page numbers from the 'page_number' field
   - Ignore any page references in content or marginalia
   - Verify all section starts match transcript page numbers

2. Sequential Analysis Process:
   - Revise the table of contents based on guidelines below:
   - Verify section lengths and organization

3. Section Organization Guidelines:
   - Level 0: Primary Divisions
     * Major formal divisions (books, parts)
     * Principal thematic units
     * Key liturgical divisions (in religious texts)
     * Main subject transitions
     Examples by genre:
     * Books of Hours: Individual offices
     * Recipe collections: Major category groups
     * Poetry: Books or major poem groupings
     * Treatises: Main books/parts

   - Level 1: Secondary Divisions
     * Formal subdivisions of main parts
     * Distinct thematic sections
     * Complete sub-units
     Examples by genre:
     * Books of Hours: Components within offices
     * Recipe collections: Specific types of recipes
     * Poetry: Individual long poems or related groups
     * Treatises: Chapters or major arguments

   - Level 2: Detailed Divisions
     * Notable subsections
     * Discrete elements
     * Significant passages
     Examples by genre:
     * Books of Hours: Individual psalms/prayers
     * Recipe collections: Notable individual recipes
     * Poetry: Short poems or stanza groups
     * Treatises: Specific discussions or examples

   Important:
   - Follow the text's natural organization
   - Section lengths vary by genre and content
   - Consider both formal and functional divisions
   - Balance between detail and navigability
   - Respect original structure while adding clarity
   - Descriptions should be a brief and clear sentence
   - Section synopses can be up to a paragraph
   - Do not put more than one section or subsection per page
   - Always make sure you have the correct page number
   Each section entry must have a title, page number, level, description, and synopsis.
   Think about the overall structure when writing synopses. 


   VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
    Each section entry MUST:
    1. Start with new content (not continuations)
    2. Have a unique, descriptive title
    3. Represent a navigable point of interest
    4. Align with document structure
    5. Be the only section on its page
    6. Fit clearly into the hierarchical structure
