Analyze this section (chunk {chunk_num}) of the manuscript and integrate it with the analysis of the text up to this point.
If this is the first chunk, create a new analysis.

MANUSCRIPT CONTEXT:
Metadata: {metadata}

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
1. Consider the manuscript's structural elements from metadata:
   - Look for documented text divisions
   - Note any formal organizational patterns
   - Consider typical structures for this manuscript type
   - Align section breaks with documented rubrics or divisions

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Page Numbers:
   - ONLY use page numbers from the 'page_number' field in the transcript
   - Disregard any page references in text content or marginalia
   - Verify all section starts align with actual page numbers

2. Iterative Page Analysis:
   - Examine each page in sequence
   - For each page, determine if it:
     * Starts new major section (Level 0)
     * Starts new subsection (Level 1)
     * Starts new sub-subsection (Level 2)
     * Does not start a new section
   - Update table of contents if and only if the page starts a new section or subsection.

3. Section Organization Guidelines:

    CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL SECTIONS:
    - Never create a section for content that merely continues from a previous page
    - Each section must represent a meaningful unit of content
    - Section titles should describe content, not page features
    - Avoid generic titles like "Continuation" or "Additional text"

    Level Definitions:

    Level 0 (Primary Divisions):
    - Major formal or structural divisions only
    - Examples:
    * Books/Parts in a multi-part work
    * Major liturgical divisions (e.g., different Hours)
    * Primary subject transitions in treatises
    * Main textual units in miscellanies
    When to use:
    - Clear break in content or format
    - New major topic or text begins
    - Significant shift in subject matter
    Never use for:
    - Continuations of existing sections
    - Minor topic changes
    - Visual changes without content breaks

    Level 1 (Secondary Divisions):
    - Formal subdivisions within primary sections
    - Examples:
    * Chapters within books
    * Components within liturgical sections
    * Major arguments in treatises
    When to use:
    - Clear subsection begins
    - New subtopic within main section
    - Distinct unit of related content
    Never use for:
    - Continuations of previous subsections
    - Minor paragraph breaks
    - Layout changes without content significance

    Level 2 (Detail Divisions):
    - Use sparingly - only for significant discrete elements
    - Examples:
    * Individual prayers in liturgical texts
    * Specific case studies in legal texts
    * Notable individual poems in collections
    When to use:
    - Only for elements that need direct reference
    - Clear standalone items within subsections
    Never use for:
    - Regular paragraph breaks
    - Continuing discussion
    - Minor textual divisions

    CRITICAL REMINDERS:
    - Structural decisions should prioritize reader navigation
    - Always ask: "Would someone want to navigate directly to this point?"
    - If in doubt about a section break, do not create one

4. Documentation Requirements:
   - Record exact page numbers for all sections
   - Note language or script changes
   - Track marginalia and annotations
   - Document physical or layout changes
   - Identify cross-references between sections
