Analyze the following manuscript and generate a comprehensive summary and a hierarchical table of contents. 
Your task is to **order the pages of the manuscript into a hierarchy of sections and subsections**, and then create a table of contents that reflects this hierarchy.
Do this by grouping pages by section, then dividing those groups into subsections in accordance with the rules below.
Then, once you have the sections and subsections worked out, create titles, descriptions, and synopses.
Then, once you have done that, the page_number for a section or subsection is the first page in the group.
INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  **Overall Structure & Hierarchy:** Begin by understanding the ENTIRE manuscript's structure.  
Identify major divisions, thematic units, and how different pages and their content relate to each other to form a coherent whole.  
Think of this as creating an outline *before* filling in the details. Mine the metadata for any clues about the manuscript's structure.

2.  **Hierarchical Table of Contents (TOC):** Create a TOC with up to three levels (0, 1, 2).  The TOC should list the *first page number* where each section or subsection begins.  Follow these STRICT guidelines:

    *   **Level 0 (Major Divisions):**
        *   Major formal divisions (books, parts, canticles).
        *   Principal thematic units that structure the entire work (e.g., major arguments, shifts in overall topic).  These units should represent *significant* divisions in the content, *not* just minor topic shifts.
        *   Key liturgical divisions (in religious texts, e.g., different Hours) *if they represent major structural divisions*.
        *   Clear transitions to entirely new subjects.
        *   *Examples:* Books within a multi-book work, major sections in a treatise, different offices in a Book of Hours.

    *   **Level 1 (Secondary Divisions):**
        *   Formal subdivisions of Level 0 sections (e.g., chapters within books).
        *   Distinct thematic sections *within* a Level 0 division. These should be complete sub-units of the larger Level 0 section.
        *   *Examples:* Chapters within a book, major arguments within a treatise section, components within a liturgical office.

    *   **Level 2 (Detailed Divisions - Use Sparingly):**
        *   Notable subsections *within* a Level 1 division.
        *   Discrete elements within a Level 1 section that warrant direct reference.
        *   Significant passages that represent a distinct subtopic or argument *within* a Level 1 section.
        *   *Examples:* Individual psalms or prayers within a larger office *if they are commonly referenced independently*, specific case studies in a legal text, individual poems within a larger collection *if they are well-known*.
        *   **CRITICAL:** Only use Level 2 if an element is truly distinct, self-contained, and likely to be sought out directly.  Do NOT use it for every paragraph, minor topic shift, or simply because a page break exists.

3.  **Section Identification Criteria:**  A new section (at any level) should represent a *meaningful* unit of content, *not* just a page break or a slight change in wording.

    *   **New Section Indicators (Strong Signals):**
        *   **Explicit Markers:** Headings, titles, rubrics, chapter numbers.
        *   **Major Topic Shifts:**  Clear changes in subject matter with *no* connecting phrases, indicating a shift to a new, distinct topic.
        *   **Text Type Changes:**  A shift from prose to poetry, dialogue to narration, or other significant changes in the *type* of text.
        *   **Direct Address to New Topic:** Phrases like "Now we will discuss..." or "Turning to the next point...".

    *   **Continuation Indicators (Weak Signals - NOT a new section *unless* accompanied by a strong signal):**
        *   **Continuing Sentences:** Sentences continuing from the previous page.
        *   **Referential Language:** Pronouns, conjunctions, or other words referring back to previous content.
        *   **Continued Lists/Sequences:** Continuation of a list, argument, or story.
        *   **Page Breaks:**  A page break *alone* is NOT sufficient to indicate a new section.  It must be accompanied by a strong indicator from the list above.

4.  **Page Numbers:**  Use ONLY the `page_number` field. The TOC entry should list the page number where the section *begins*. Ignore any page references within the text or marginalia.

5. **Summary Content:** Provide a concise and informative summary covering these aspects:

    *   **Title:** The main title of the manuscript.
    *   **Alternative Titles:** Other known titles.
    *   **Shelfmark:** The manuscript's unique identifier.
    *   **Repository:** The institution holding the manuscript.
    *   **Date Range:** The estimated date range (start and end years).
    *   **Languages:** The languages used in the manuscript.
    *   **Scribes:** Known scribes (if any).
    *   **Physical Description:**
        *   **Material:** Writing material (e.g., parchment, paper).
        *   **Dimensions:** Size of the manuscript.
        *   **Condition:** State of preservation.
        *   **Layout:** Page layout and organization.
        *   **Script Type:** The style of writing.
        *   **Decoration:** Artistic elements or illuminations.
    *   **Contents Summary:**  A comprehensive overview of the manuscript's contents.
    *   **Historical Context:** The historical background and setting.
    *   **Significance:**  The manuscript's scholarly importance.
    *   **Themes:**  Major themes or topics addressed.
    *   **Provenance:**  The history of ownership (if known).
